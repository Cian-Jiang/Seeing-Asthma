We can't see the air quality, the weather quality and the pollen in the air through our eyes, so our name is Seeing Asthma, which means we can deliver better knowledge about asthma to our users through our product, and at the same time, we can use the core function of image recognition on our website to detect the possible allergens in the user's living environment. Detecting possible allergens, turning invisible sources of infection into tangible data to be displayed to users.
